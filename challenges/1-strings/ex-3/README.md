# LowerCase Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `lowerCase` that accepts a string as its parameter and returns the same string but converted to lowercase. For example, if the input is "HELLO", the output should be "hello".

## Function signature

```typescript
export function lowerCase(str: string): string;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file**: Start by creating a file named `lowerCase.ts`.
2. **Define the function**: Use the provided function signature as a guide to define your function.
3. **Export the Function**: Ensure that your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function**: Once you've implemented your function, you can test it by running the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- lowerCase
```
