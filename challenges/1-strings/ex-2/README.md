# Get Character Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `getChar`. This function should take a string `str` and a number `index` as parameters. It should return the character at the given `index` from the string `str`. For example, if provided with the string `"hello"` and the index `1`, the function should return `"e"`.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function getChar(str: string, index: number): string;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Create a file named `getChar.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Implement the function to extract the character at the specified index from the string.
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure that your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function:** After defining your function, test it to ensure it works correctly. To do this, run the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- getChar
```
