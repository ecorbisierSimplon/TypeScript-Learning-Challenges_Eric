# Reverse String Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `reverseString` that will accept a string as a parameter and return a new string that represents the original string reversed.

For example: If provided with the string "TypeScript", the function should return "tpircSepyT".

## Function signature

```typescript
export function reverseString(str: string): string;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Create a file named `reverseString.ts`.
2. **Define the function.**
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure that your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function:** After implementing your function, test it to ensure it's working correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- reverseString
```
