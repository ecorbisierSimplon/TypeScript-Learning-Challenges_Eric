# ConcatStrings Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `concatStrings`. This function should take in two string parameters and return a single string that is the result of concatenating the first string, a space, and then the second string.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function concatStrings(a: string, b: string): string;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Begin by creating a file named `concatStrings.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Within this file, implement the function as per the provided signature.
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure your function is exported so that it can be imported and tested in other modules.
4. **Testing your function:** Once you've implemented your function, run the following command in your terminal to test its correctness:

```Bash
npm test -- concatStrings
```
