# Floor Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `floor`. This function will take a single number as its parameter and return the largest integer less than or equal to the given number. Essentially, the `floor` function rounds a number down to the nearest integer. For example, the floor of 4.7 is 4.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function floor(x: number): number;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file**: Make a new file named `floor.ts`.
2. **Define the function**: Implement the logic to round the number down to its nearest integer.
3. **Export the Function**: Ensure your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function**: Run the following command in your terminal to test your function:

```Bash
npm test -- floor
```
