# Fibonacci Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `fibonacci` that computes the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1. The next number in the sequence is found by adding the two numbers before it.

**Note:** For this exercise, the sequence starts with Fibonacci(0) = 0 and Fibonacci(1) = 1.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function fibonacci(n: number): number;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Start by creating a file named `fibonacci.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Implement the Fibonacci algorithm considering the initial conditions (i.e., Fibonacci(0) = 0 and Fibonacci(1) = 1).
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure that your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function:** To verify the correctness of your function, run the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- fibonacci
```
