# Round Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `round`. The function should take a single number as its parameter. It should then round this number to the nearest whole number using standard mathematical rounding rules (e.g., 1.4 becomes 1 and 1.5 becomes 2) and return the result.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function round(x: number): number;
```

## Instructions:

1. Create a file: Begin by creating a file named `round.ts`.
2. Define the function: Implement the function logic to round the input number to its nearest whole value.
3. Export the Function: Ensure your function is exported from the module, so it can be imported and tested in other parts of the project.
4. Testing your function: To ensure your function behaves as expected, test it by running the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- round
```
