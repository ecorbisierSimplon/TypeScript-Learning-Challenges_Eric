# Power Function

## Objective:

Your task is to create a TypeScript function named `pow` that computes the result of raising a base number to an exponent. In other words, for given numbers `base` and `exponent`, the function should return base<sup>exponent</sup>.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function pow(base: number, exponent: number): number;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Begin by creating a file named `pow.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Use the provided signature to define the `pow` function. Implement the function to compute and return the result of raising the `base` number to the given `exponent`.
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure your function is exported from the module, making it available for import and testing in other modules.
4. **Testing your function:** Once your function is written, you can test it by running the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- pow
```
