# Max Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `max` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the larger of the two numbers.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function max(a: number, b: number): number;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Begin by creating a file named `max.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Implement the function that compares the two numbers and returns the larger one.
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure that your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function:** To verify the correctness of your implementation, run the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- max
```
