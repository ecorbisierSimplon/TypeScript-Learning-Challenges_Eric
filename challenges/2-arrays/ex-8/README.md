# Sum of Values Function

## Objective:

Your task is to create a TypeScript function named `sumOfValues` that calculates and returns the sum of all values within an array of numbers.

For example: Given an array `[2, 3, 5]`, the function should return `10` since `2 + 3 + 5 = 10`.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function sumOfValues(array: number[]): number;
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Begin by creating a file named `sumOfValues.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Using the provided function signature, define your function to compute the sum of all values in the provided array.
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure that your function is exported from the module. This will allow it to be imported and tested in other parts of the project.
4. **Testing your function:** Once you have implemented your function, you can test its correctness by running the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- sumOfValues
```

Remember to use the provided example as a guide to understand the expected behavior of the function.
