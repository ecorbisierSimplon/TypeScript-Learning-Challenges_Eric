# Plus One Each Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `plusOneEach` that takes an array of numbers as its parameter. For each number in the array, you should add 1 and then return a new array containing the incremented numbers.

**Example:**
If the input array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the returned array should be `[2, 3, 4]`.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function plusOneEach(arr: number[]): number[];
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a file:** Start by creating a file named `plusOneEach.ts`.
2. **Define the function:** Implement the function based on the provided signature and objective.
3. **Export the Function:** Ensure that your function is exported from the module so it can be imported and tested elsewhere.
4. **Testing your function:** Once you've written the function, you can test its correctness. To do so, run the following command in your terminal:

```Bash
npm test -- plusOneEach
```
